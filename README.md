#JavaScript Journey
This repository chronicled my daily progress as I mastered JavaScript during my MERN Stack Web Development course. It captured my learning experience, from grasping the basics like variables, loops, and functions to tackling advanced topics such as DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming with promises and async/await, and building interactive projects.

Having completed this JavaScript phase, this repository now serves as a milestone of my growth as a developer. It showcases the exercises, mini-projects, and concepts I explored, which equipped me with the skills needed to advance in my MERN Stack journey. This collection remains a valuable resource for revisiting my foundational work in JavaScript.
